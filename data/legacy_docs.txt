SYSTEM: LEGACY_PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_V1
AUTHOR: J. DOE

OVERVIEW:
The Legacy Payment Processor V1 (LPP-V1) is a COBOL-based batch processing system designed to handle credit card transactions for the retail sector. It runs on the Mainframe Z9000.

MODULES:
1. MOD_INIT_01: Initializes the daily batch. It reads from the TAPE_DRIVE_A.
   - ERROR_CODE_99: Tape not mounted.
2. MOD_PROC_02: Processes transactions.
   - LOGIC: If TRANS_AMT > 10000, flag for MANUAL_REVIEW.
   - DEPENDENCY: Requires TABLE_RATES_98 to be loaded in memory.
3. MOD_FIN_03: Finalizes the batch and prints the report to PRINTER_LP01.

CONFIGURATION:
- Config file is located at /etc/lpp/config.dat (binary format).
- To update rates, run the separate utility UPDATE_RATES.EXE.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- The system crashes if the transaction date is Feb 29th on a non-leap year (bug in date validation routine DATE_CHECK_SUB).
- Do not restart MOD_PROC_02 without clearing the TEMP_CACHE table, otherwise double billing occurs.
